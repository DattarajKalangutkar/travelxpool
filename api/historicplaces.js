      "As Our Indian history precisely states, India was ruled by the British whereas Goa was ruled by the Portuguese for over 450 years. Portuguese traveled to Goa via waterways &  invaded Goa in 1510, defeating the Bijapur Sultanate.  It is said by locals since Goa is covered by beautiful Ghats on its western side, the Portuguese assumed it to be the only land, and after that only mountains were present hence they didn’t go further hunting for land and later realized that the assumption wasn’t true.",
      "Here we are going to Discuss one such beautiful historical heritage of Goa i.e  Aguada Fort. It is one of the monuments that is being well preserved by Goa Tourism. Aguada fort is one of the architecture that Portugues left behind for the Goans to preserve. Aguada Fort was one of the intellectually constructed monuments by the Portuguese in the 16th Century. Its precise construction was completed by the year 1613. The intention of building this fort was to gain protection from Dutch & Marathas, to defend the shipping dock of the Bardez sub-district & also it served as a source of freshwater for the shipping industry of the region. This is the very reason why this fort was crowned with the name `Aguada Fort` (Agua meaning water in Portuguese). The fort is situated at the bank of Mandovi river and hence one can enjoy the view of the confluence of Mandovi river & Arabian sea. The passing ships used to acquire freshwater from the fort.",
      "It was the Reign of the Catholic Kingdom Filipe of Portugal when construction of this fort began. It was well monitored by Viceroy Ruy Tavara. The Portuguese employed Italian military architects to build an impenetrable fort. Aguada Fort’s location is such a way that it fulfilled the purpose of protection to Portuguese during the 16th century which was lacking by nearby forts like Terekhol, Charpora, Rachel, Reis Magos, Cabo De Rama, Gasper Dias port. Architects made use of Laterite stone for construction. The height of the wall is around 5m with a thickness of 1.3m. The fort has been built on Bardez Peninsula and the area of the fort covers the whole peninsula.",
      "Besides having sections for ships and fort, the monument also has prisons, barracks, living quarters & chapel. The Chapel was dedicated to “our lady of Good Voyage”, where the incoming ship travelers would anchor and restock before setting out for another voyage. The title is used to denote the Virgin Mary and it is said to have originated amongst the seafaring communities of Portugal. The walls of the fort were surrounded by bastions having parapets to fire cannons. Mae de Agua or Mother of Water is a spring that exists even today. The fort is square and has bastions on three sides for using artillery. The fourth side has a gate that faces a step towards the river.",
      "The fort is also rich with fascinating lighthouses. The four-story lighthouse, erected in 1864 is the oldest of its kind in Asia. It is used to emit light through lamps after every seven minutes. Before the construction of this lighthouse, bonfires were used to guide the ships to the harbors. The bonfires were lit on the Hill of Pilots. This lighthouse was abandoned in 1976 and a new lighthouse was constructed. Tourists can climb up the new lighthouse by giving a small amount and can view the surroundings from the top. The lighthouse has a curving staircase that goes up to the lamphouse. A copper plaque is also there in the commemoration of Viceroy Ruy Tavara and the architect of the fort. A bell was also there in the lighthouse which later became a part of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Church in Panaji.",
      "Fort Aguada jail was once Goa’s largest prison. Because of its use, it was not opened to the public. It was the Salazar administration that converted a part of this fort into a jail. At the beginning of 1946, a group of protestors demanding integration of Goa with India was imprisoned here.There is a statue of a woman breaking out chains & a man cradling a child in front of the jail that depicts the freedom struggle in Goa. Just behind these statues, there is the national emblem of India, The Ashokan Pillar.",
      "Even today, years after the construction of this monument, it is not difficult to comprehend the strategic importance of this marvel. On the other hand, it gazes over the vast expanse of the Arabian Sea which keeps us reminding the arrival of the colonial powers of the west. The secret and winding passages of the fort symbolize the intense and complex power struggles for trade & dominance."
