                    Goa is very much popular in India as well all over the world. It is lucky enough to possess rich natural beauty, gifted coastal lines & fascinating culture. I am praising Goa's beauty as I am proud to be a Goan. According to its popular history, it is a land of `Parshurama` a great Hindu warrior of ancient times. As it has been said, he is the one who created this land by his legendary act. Hence, Goa has intensified culture and ethical values which Goan people have taken care of till today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So here, I am going to write about a special festival known as "Shigmotsav" which is deliberately celebrated in goa so that every goal generation should have a taste of their ancestral culture.Many small events come to Shigmotsav. Every Goan Village has different virtue of celebrating this festival as per their village rituals. One such event is ‘Gode Modni'’
                </p>

                <p>
                    Briefly, it’s a folk dance that is performed in some parts of Goa, which lie near the northern boundaries of Goa. It represents the horse (ghode) mounted cavalier, setting off to war. Ghode Modni (‘Ghode’ means ‘horse’ and ‘Modni’ means ‘gyrations and dance-like movements) is a dance involving horse-like movements. It is a spectacular warrior dance commemorating the victory of the Ranes, the Maratha rulers of the Sattari taluka in Goa, over the Portuguese. The costume is like that of a Rajput chieftain but the headdress used is a Peshwai puggree worn by the Maratha rulers. 
                </p>
                <div class="storyimages">
                    <img src="images/tales/godimundi/mundi_1.jpeg" alt="godi Mundi" title="godi Mundi">
                </div>
                <p>
                    The kshatriya dancers also wear headgears made of colorful flowers, done in full traditional livery, fix at the waist effigy of a wooden horse beautifully bridled and decorated with colorful clothes, and carry ghungrus in the ankles. Holding the bridle in one hand and brandishing a naked sword with the other hand, the dancers move forward and backward to the beat of drums, Dhol, Tasha, and Cymbals to recreate the prancing of war horses. Two or eight dancers, fastened inside hobby-horses below their waist, brandishing swords, execute their warlike dance to the beat of the dholak and Tasha. There are no accompanying songs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dancers go as far as the village limits and return while performing this exotic folk dance. The influence behind this seems to be entirely northern. This dance is popular in Bicholim, Pernem and Sattari talukas once ruled by the Marathas. It is mostly performed during the Shigmo festival.
                </p>
                <div class="storyimages">
                    <img src="images/tales/godimundi/mundi_2.jpeg" alt="godi Mundi" title="godi Mundi">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Specifically talking about Bicholim Taluka, this is played in Villages like Sanquliem, Parye, etc. In Saqueliem, this event takes place at Radha-Krishna Temple. As said earlier, this war is between two warriors who get into a rage by the notion music of Dhol. This music makes them thrill and increases their anger. These two warriors hold the Sword (Talvar). In the Notion of anger, they try to attack each other considering they are enemies. As per the ritual, before starting the fight they pray to God (Lord Shiva ) to happen the process without causing many disasters. When the fight starts, the worriers will play which means they will attack each with a sword till the time one of them loses by putting down their sword. Also, it is said while playing this, God enters into their soul, in Konkani we call it `Bhar yeylo` till the time they lose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is one of the events that Goans are still maintaining which they have gained from ancestors and passing them to their future generations which will bind them together.
                </p>
