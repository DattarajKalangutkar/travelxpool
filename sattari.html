                <p>
                    Sattari or Taluka with seventy Villages is one of the most beautiful places with most of the Village composed with greenery around. Valpoi in sattari Taluka is like the headquarters with the municipal council for the rest of the villages. 
                    Sattari consists of the highest number of most beautiful waterfalls. The main reason behind this is the Mhadie river which is kind of like the Mandovi River. the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary covers 208 km2 of the Sattari Taluka.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Pernen, Bardez is famous during the winter and summer season, just because of the beaches, same way Sattari is famous for during rainy season just for the waterfalls. As the Sattari is surrounded by dense forest it kind of became the most important taluka. The Sahyadri Parvat Mala and chorla forest cover the Sattari Taluka.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As People called or compare the Sattari forest with the Amazon rain forest, not just because it is dense, but also because it consists of nature's most beautiful waterfalls. Not just the jungles, where the nature scene memorizes the view to the tourist so that they should travel the place every year. So, in short, it kind became or made the attraction to the lots of tourists as well the local people to visit the place.

                    <div class="title">Hivre Waterfall</div>
                    <div class="subsection">

Its beauty can be seen from the far in the dense forest of chorla ghat. To view this waterfall, people need to track it for about 2 hours. The Cloud down the sky, greenery everywhere make the day more memorizing and along the waterfall.

                </div>
                <div class="talukatable">
                    <div class="title">Charavane Waterfall</div>
                    <div class="subsection">
                        Charavane is one of the two cascading waterfalls in Goa (the other being Bamanbudo). It has multiple levels and you can stop at anyone to enjoy the waters. It is predominantly a seasonal waterfall, which means you will have to visit in July, August, and maybe early September for the best experience. 
                    </div>
                    <div class="subsection">
                        The rains bring a lot of water to these forests and there are streams formed everywhere even the villages turn lush green and the temperatures drop. For this waterfall to reach, it mostly needs a 45 min trek to reach the destination from the village point. The villager is a guide kind of person for the waterfalls, so they exactly instruct the way to the waterfall. 
                    </div>
                    <div class="subsection">
                        In so same way for this waterfall, they instruct a big gigantic mango tree to come in the way if the tree comes or gets in the way while trekking then it is understood that the trekker is on the right path get to see the beautiful waterfall. So basically to reach the waterfall trekker has to cross around 2 or 3 streams to get to the final waterfall.
