                    Goa is the hub of its unique culture & cultural practices that are carried forward from our ancestors. Recently we are speaking a lot about Shimoga Utsav(a springtime festival ) that mixes all types of folklore in a fascinating presentation. Holi (Festival of color) is together with so many other cultural events along with the parade of floats across cities, rather it is about bringing back the traditional fervor of legends, tales, and folklore together. Along with traditional folklore, springtime is also about celebrating Jatra’s along with other traditional feasts. For example, at various places Various temples do have jatra organized by the respective Villagers or people from various communities like  Gaondongri at Canacona gathered to celebrate Shree Mallikarjun Jatra and, Mayekars gathered for their annual Palki at Mahalaxmi Temple.

                    Talking about folk culture, Ranmale is one of the folk Dances that is portrayed in North Goa. Ranmale is a ritualistic and folk theatre form based on mythological stories from the popular Indian epics, the Ramayana, and the Mahabharata. It is performed during the Holi festival which is celebrated as Shigmo (spring festival) in Goa and the Konkan region. The word ‘Ranmale’ has evolved from two words, ‘Ran’ which means battle, and ‘Male’ representing the traditional torch used as a source of light during the performance.

                <p>
                    Ranmale is mainly performed in Western India in the Sattari Taluka of North Goa District and Sanguem Taluka of South Goa District. It is also performed in the border villages of Maharashtra like Mangeli, and Patye and is also practiced in Karnataka in the villages of Chikhale, Kankumbi, Parwad, and Gawali, Degao.

                <p>
                    It is believed that its origin is rooted in ancient times when a group of visiting artists, peeved by the demands of the local settlers, killed them while they were engrossed in watching the performance, and since then, Ranmale is performed as an act of atonement for that act. This form comprises dance, drama, and folk songs called Jats.

                    Each participant in the drama makes his entry to the tune of folk songs. The traditional instrument, Ghumat is an earthenware drum with one of its ends covered with the skin of the monitor lizard and the other mouth kept open. The accompanying instrument Kansale, cymbals of brass, are used for the base rhythm. Jats are sung by the initiator of the folk drama called the Sutradhar, while the folk artists stand in a row on the stage acting as a backdrop.

                    In the village of Zarme, the presentation of Ranmale is a must after the annual festival of Chorotsav. The agricultural and forest-dwelling communities of Western Ghats of Goa are the bearers of this tradition. It is practiced by valips and Gaonkars, the forest-dwelling communities of Sanguem Taluka of the South Goa district. It is also performed by the agricultural communities, locally known as the Nave Marathe and Zune Marathe in Zarme and Caranzole of Sattari Taluka of North Goa.

                    Apart from Goa & Goan border Villages that are shared with Maharastra. In bhogoli, a village of chandgad taluka in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur district, the nine-day shigmo celebration concludes with a performance of the Ranmale near the temple of Ravalnath in the wee hours of the morning followed by an invocation to Lord Ganpati, enacted by performer bearing wooden masks of the elephant-headed god.
