                    Pernem taluka, the Northmost taluka of goa is surrounded by almost two most beautiful rivers of Goa. One is the Chapora river which is bounded at the south of Pernem taluka and the other is Tiracol River which is bounded entirely to the north side of Pernem Taluka. The distance between the Capital city of Goa which is Panjim to the Pernem taluka is almost around 27km.
