                <p>
                    Betqui is a beautiful village surrounded by beautiful nature with various agricultural fields and lands, trees, and water bodies. Every Goan village has its own culture, temples, rituals, tales, etc. Betqui village also has its own unique story wherein villagers of Betqui practice non-eating of rice for 24 hrs.</p>
                <p>
                    The story goes like this, Centuries back this village was cursed by the widowed mother of gram Devi Shri. Mandodari maata and Narbando. The story behind the curse is that some centuries ago the native villagers of Betqui wanted to construct a small dam to hold the water in one place for the agricultural purpose to cultivate rice mainly but every time they tried to build the dam, their work went in vain as the dam was not able to hold the water as dams wall gets collapse every time they built a wall. So to get a solution for this all the villagers decided to give human sacrifice as the last option.

                <p>
                    Near the dam site, One widow mother used to live with her daughter Mandodari and son Narbando. Villagers choose the widow's kids as the bait for the sacrifice, so they trick the mother and kids, and gave their sacrifice. When upon the news of the demise of her kids, in anger mother gave the curse on the Betqui village that no human will be able to cook and eat the rice on this land. Soon after that curse started to show its effects, the native villagers did an exodus out of fear from the village.

                <p>
                    Years after this event, the native Phadte Goankar community from Verna,  relocated to the Betqui, came to know about the curse. To undo this curse, they try to visit the mother of the sacrificed kids, but she had moved to some other place and was not able to reach by the villagers But after searching for days, the villagers found the mother and asked for her forgiveness and upon the plead by the Phadte Goankar community mother finally change the curse to the 24 hours for every year, which observed that no villagers cooking and eating rice for 24 hours between April and May.
                <p>
                    Temple of the Shri. Mandodari Maata and Shri. Narbando was built by villagers in their memories. Vardhapan divas (birth anniversary) of the Shri. Mandodari takes place in December. On the occasion of the Maha Shivratri, the palanquin of Shri. Mandodari goes to the place of his mother which is near the place where native villagers built the dam wall.
