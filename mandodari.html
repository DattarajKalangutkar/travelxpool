                    Betqui is a beautiful village surrounded by beautiful nature with various agricultural fields and lands, trees, and water bodies as every Goan village has its own culture, temples, rituals, tales, etc. Betqui village also has its tale wherein villagers of Betqui practice non-eating of rice for 24 hrs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    History has it says that there was a curse upon this village by the widowed mother of gram Devi Shri. Mandodari maata and Narbando. The story behind the curse is that some centuries ago the native villagers of Betqui wanted to construct a small dam to hold the water in one place for the agricultural purpose to cultivate rice mainly but every time they try to build the dam their work went in vain as the dam was not able to hold the water and dams wall gets collapse every time they built a new wall so to get the solution for this all the villagers decided to give the human sacrifice as last option.
                </p>

                <p>
                    villagers decided to give the human sacrifice as last option. Beside the dam construction site, there was a widow who used to have stayed with her daughter Mandodari and son Narbando. Villagers choose the widow's kids as the bait for the sacrifice and well-planned, they trick the kids and gave their sacrifice. When upon the news of the demise of her kids in anger Mother of the kids gave the curse on the Betqui village that no rice will be able to cultivate or no human will be able to cook and eat the rice on this land. Soon after that curse started to show its effects and in fear the native villagers did an exodus from the village.

                <p>
                    Years after this event the native Phadte Goankar community from Verna who relocated to the Betqui came to know about the curse and to undo the curse they try to visit the mother of the sacrificed kids but she had moved to some other place and was not able to reach by villagers But after searching from days they trace the Mothers and asked for her forgiveness and upon the plead by the Phadte Goankar community mother finally change the curse to the 24 hours for every year which is observed villagers not cooking and eating rice for 24 hours between April and May.

                <p>
                    Temple of the Shri. Mandodari Maata and Shri. Narbando is built by villagers in their memory. Vardhapan divas i.e birth anniversary of the Shri. Mandodari is observed in December. On the occasion of the Maha Shivratri, the palanquin of Shri. Mandodari goes to the place of his Mother which is near the place where native villagers tried to build the dam wall.
