                    Science does not believe in Ghosts, the Dark World, spirits, witches, negative forces, or even God. But We people have certain beliefs on all of them though without proof. Some beliefs are taken forward by our ancestors for our sake.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Gade Utsav in different villages of Goa, basically led by Devchar during Shigmo. This Utsav happens in many Villages of Goa and some of them are Sal (most popular ), Kudne, Navelim, Karapur, Cancona, Pilgao, Vidde, etc. The Gade Utsav/ Gadyanchi Jatra is all about ghosts (bhuta in Konkani) & holy spirits (Devchar).`Devchar ` is a big mysterious person in Goa. Devchar means- “The one who has gone the god’s way” in the Konkani language. `Devchar` is also known as ‘Rakhandar’ of the particularly in Villages. He acts as God and helps villagers to keep them safe from the dark world, curses, difficulties, etc. Villagers worship him as a  God because he shields the village boundaries from the entry of evil spirits. A 'Devchar' is believed to be a giant wearing a white dhoti, with a 'kambal' on his shoulder and a bamboo stick in his hand. Every village has a protector spirit or 'Rakhandar' who guards their locality. They are offered roosters, local liquor, and 'beedis' by the locals as an appreciation for protecting them from evil spirits. It is said that Devchar goes for a walk to a defined route every day during night time. So if that route falls under someone’s property they have to keep it clean, pleasant and should stop that route for any reason. As humans begin, we should not even see him during this ferry(walk). It’s highly forbidden. In case, someone happens to see him he should immediately pray to him and ask for his forgiveness. If you go against him, he will teach you a bitter lesson and at worst you can end up your life too. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Goa, Most of the Villages have their Rakhandar according to village boundaries and during Shimgo Utsav he plays a crucial role. Gade Utsav exactly happens 2 nights before holy night. The Holy day & before nights are not defined. It varies from village to village. Even the rituals & procedure varies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Briefly talking about, Devchar will take some bunch of male villagers along with him for 2 days. These men will be unconscious. They don’t know what they do but they are all protected by Lord Shiva & Devchar. So these men will follow  Devchar. Devchar will go to all the places where dark forces are alive, carry the dead remains and bring that to a specific temple on a holy night i.e third night. Now Devchar commands them to visit the temple with whatever collections they have collected for the last 2 days. In front of the temple, a big campfire is arranged where this gade will form a circle around it. It is said, it's very difficult to process because dark forces will try to stop them from completing around the fire. After all, if they complete they will have to leave earth & Gade will become free from Devchar  & can come back to normal life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of the above is carried out in certain procedures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Poinguinim, Cancona, there is a Betal temple which is associated with Gadyanchi Jatra that is celebrated during April once in 3 years. Four males dressed in a white dhoti known as gade take part in the ceremony along with other devotees. In front of the Betal temple, a tall platform of areca nut trunk is erected on which gade are suspended by a hook to a revolving wheel. Only when the audience declares to the male gade that they are satisfied then only the gade is set to free.

                <p>
                    Sal (Bicholim ), is famous for Gadyachi jatra' which attracts a large crowd from Goa and the border areas of Maharashtra and Karnataka. On the day of holy Purnima, a wooden trunk of a mango tree which is decorated with mango leaves is erected near the Mahadev temple.As per the Hindu tradition, Mahadev is believed to be the god of ghosts. On the second night of holi, the person dressed in the white dhoti assembles at the sacred place called "mand". As soon as a crowd (romat) comes to the mand dancing to the beats of dhol and tasha, the villagers get the blessings of all the deities of the village.

                <p>
                    Elderly people sit nearby singing non-stop folk songs called "naman" to the beats of dhol. There are 52 people also known as 'gade' belonging to Raut, Parab, Naik, Ghure, Mhale, Mesta communities dressed in dhotis move around the pole which is erected on the mand. It is believed that under the trance they all run in the direction of the hill wherein they are taken into the forest by a mysterious torch shown by the spirit called devchar'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes he lights the torch on the top of the tree, then suddenly on the ground. The lighting and extinguishing process of the torch mesmerizes the people who come specially to witness this phenomenon. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the three nights, the devchar shows chudti or torch. He also hides a few gades on trees or inside the temple. On these nights, the hidden gades who are unconscious are handed over by the devchar to other gades by lighting the torch.Afterward, they are brought to the sacred place. The unconscious gades return to their senses when sacred water is poured into their mouth. During the whole night, these gades go to all the places where the holy spirits reside. They also visit the crematorium and carry remnants of burnt dead bodies in their hands for some time along with the votive clay figures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Kudne, The Kudne Gadyanchi Jatra is held for three nights without lighting any type of lamp(Villagers put off their lights after 10 pm till the morning 6 am, as Villagers says light to act as disturbance of this process), whereas in Sal lighting of lamps is allowed. Villagers say, "We have continued the tradition of Gadyanchi Jatra to rid off the wrath of ghosts and evil spirits."
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Other Villages, Common process: Drums beat to the signal that the Gade is approaching, men dressed in white dhotis who participated in the ritual near the temple. It begins on the night of Holi with prayers offered before a coconut kept at the 'mand' a sacred place of the community. After the prayer, the 'Gade' head to the forest during nighttime. In Hindu tradition, Mahadev, the god of ghosts is believed to protect these Gade while they are in the forest. In the morning, they return to the 'mand'.Depending upon the village you will see many videos on youtube explaining the same. It also shows people’s experience when they encounter Devchar / Gade.
