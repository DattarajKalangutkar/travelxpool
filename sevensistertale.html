                    Among these all sisters, they had a little brother, whose name is khetoba. There was a total of 8 siblings. Here there is an interesting story behind these seven sisters and one brother.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This story begins when these siblings ravel to Goa from the Western Ghats. It is said that they came to Goa on an elephant after forced conversions began in the Ghats. At first, they visited Goddess Shantadurga in Goankarwada in Bicholim. They asked the Goddess for a place to take shelter. Goddess Shantadurga gave a one-day shelter at her place. After the day's rest at the Shantadurga place, the Goddess Shanta Durga sent them Mayem. In a place called "Vhodnar" at the boundary of mayhem, their people can see a sculpture of an elephant and a snake at that place. After the shantadurga's suggestion, the seven sisters and a brother khetoba started living in mayem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So the actual tales start from here, after they settle in Mayem or do a conversation or have rest, so sister decides to find firewood to cook food. So what the seven sisters decided is that they send their brother Khetoba to the forest to collect the firewood. As being a small in the family, and also a very sister favorite, he decides to collect the firewood from the forest. So khetoba went to the forest to gather firewood with excitement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So on way to the forest, Khetoba saw a group of children. These children were playing with marbles, which was kind of a famous game or a kind of enjoyable game for every child. Kheltoba also enjoyed this marbles game. so what khetoba do is that he just sat there while watching the children playing marbles. On the other side, there the sister got worried thinking of their brother who had not returned home. So they decided to look for him, in this, the elder sister decided to go and look for Khetoba in the forest. So after looking here and there, asking people if they had seen her brother Khetoba, she finally found herself sitting and busy watching the children playing with marbles. After watching her brother, she made her angry thinking that after all this while she was continuously searching for her brother because all the seven sisters cared for him and he made his time to watch the little children playing marbles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The situation was very tense and she could control her anger, which made to lift her leg to kick his brother Khetoba. So she just lifted her leg, not to kick her brother.After seeing her sister in an angry mood, he got very scared. In that scary situation, Khetoba twisted his waist and missed the kick. It is said that someone will find the Khetoba standing with the twisted waist in his sculpture. In that situation, Khetoba felt bad that his elder sister tried to kick him. Everyone who was present and looking at them, Khetoba felt very insulted and embarrassed. After being insulted, Khetoba decided not to go back with the sisters. The elder sister felt sorry and requested him to return home. But khetoba did not listen to her elder sister.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other sisters who were at home and now waiting for their elder sister and younger brother to return home, decide to all go and search for them. In a worrying situation, they all look at them here and there, and finally, they all reached the spot where the two elder sisters and younger brother were present. So after listening to all the stories from her elder sister, other sisters also started pleading with Khetoba to come home. Khetoba did not listen to anyone.
